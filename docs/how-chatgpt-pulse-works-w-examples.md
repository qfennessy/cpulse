# How ChatGPT Pulse works
ChatGPT does research on your behalf referencing past chats to identify what you might find useful. Memory, including both reference saved memories and reference chat history, must be enabled to use ChatGPT Pulse. Learn more about memory.

Research is done overnight and delivered in the morning so you can start the day with new insights and suggestions. For example, if you had asked ChatGPT about ways to improve your urban garden, Pulse may show you additional tips as the season changes or it may remember you love tomatoes and give you research on the best variety you can grow in your space, anticipating you might be interested in planting them.

What you see in Pulse refreshes every day, but you can save anything you see as a chat by tapping the “save icon” in any of the visual summaries to keep or revisit later.

Every summary in Pulse gives you the option to expand it to give it more information or ask follow up questions. For example, if you get an update about new hiking trails to explore, you could ask a follow up question about the weather in the area that weekend.

Curating topics in ChatGPT Pulse
Pulse surfaces suggested topics by drawing on several signals, including:

ChatGPT memories – personalized insights based on what the user has saved or referenced.

Card interactions – e.g., thumbs up/down.

Curate feedback – direct input from the user.

Connected apps – if the user has chosen to enable them.

News & trends – timely, relevant topics, including adjacent content related to what the user has previously explored.

The goal is to balance personalization with discovery, so you see not only familiar topics, but also new, relevant information.

Every topic shown in Pulse passes through layered safety checks to avoid showing harmful content that violates our model or usage policies.
