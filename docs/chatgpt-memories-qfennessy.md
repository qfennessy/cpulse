The web UI and CLI are not fully integrated with the backend.

Is interested in using a voice agent with an application that has a database for an AI family historian project. The historian would interview a person to organically learn about family members and their relationships, asking enough detail to frame family stories without being too intrusive. The historian would then collect these stories, associating them with users in a retrievable way for other family members. User is building an application to record family history and family stories. Each story can be associated with one or multiple family members. The application stores information about a person, including events like marriages (with start and end dates), military service (with beginning and end dates), places they have lived, and employment history.
